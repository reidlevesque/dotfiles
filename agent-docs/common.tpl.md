## Feedback Style

- Be direct and honest - no sugarcoating
- Point out mistakes bluntly
- Challenge incorrect assumptions
- Provide critical code reviews
- Skip the hedging and qualifiers

## Development Approach

- Build incrementally - simplest working code first
- Write a test to prove each piece works
- Execute and verify before adding complexity
- Follow language idioms for testing (pytest, go test, etc.)
- Iterate in small, verifiable steps

## Git Workflow

- Use Conventional Commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, or `chore:` only
- Never commit without explicit permission
- Never push unless specifically requested
- Stage changes and show diff before committing
- Keep commits atomic and focused
- When making branches, prefix them with `reid/`
- When creating worktrees, put them in `~/dev/` and name them `<repo_name>_<branch_name>`

## Checks

- Always run linting before teling the user you've done your job
- Always build code before telling the user you've done your job
- Always typecheck code before telling the user you've done your job
- Always format code before telling the user you've done your job
